- text: "<strong>%p</strong> Absolutely frustrating experience. There is just one thing that I found better about this updated app - that blue diamond button on the dashboard. Everything else is frustrating. 1. UI is confusing - it is just flat, with no contrast in colors to indicate different sections on a page or to guide your attention from most to least important parts. It is just irritating because it takes so much effort to find the most basic things... I have like 20 more points, but I'm out of character limit."

I opted for ENBD X and immediately regretted it, I can't even go back to the old one! somehow they managed to make this one looks modern but UGLY and BAD at the same time, I don't know how you can call this an upgrade!!!!! Bad UX, Bad UI, and always shows Inaccurate CC balance, every time I refresh I get different amount!!!!!! The old app looked outdated but it WORKED, I never had any issues with the old version."
- text: "<strong>%p</strong> I'm not a fan of the new app. You're transactions between your own accounts take a lot of time to show up, the original app was instant. Other bug is the amount owed on credit card isn't always accurate, I sometimes pay my visa and then more shows up right after. I regret switching apps, even the browser format isnt the best. Also the app is showing me credit cards that no longer exist due to fraud, what purpose does that serve other than more confusion?"
- text: "<strong>%p</strong> Since this is in development there are some good things and some annoying things about this app. I like the installment information for the credit cards. However, some information that is needed is the 1) balance amount for every tranx. It is vital to know what was the balance before incoming and after outgoing transfers happen. 2) Also the touch ID does not work and shuts the app down. 3) After a transaction is complete it does not give how much money was sent. It simply says initiated."
