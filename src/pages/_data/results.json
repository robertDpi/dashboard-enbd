Trying transferring btw my own A/C and it wouldn't even let me change the a/c. Have to go to settings and change my favourite a/c 2. Homepage, font, and layout is horrible. So difficult to read and understand 3. While paying bills, you expect us to put a random amount, then click on next, then learn what the actual bill is and then change the amount again. This is rubbish. Please revert to the old app and don't ask to send an email, that is useless.", 'Horrible!!! A lot of options are missing including quick remittance, now when I try to open the app it is showing "session expired" re initiate the process- then I click login it is coming same error window. Still I couldn\'t login😒😒', "A lot of features are missing , a lot of bugs in app. My CC (webcard) removed from app as soon as i shifted to this version. CC outstanding amount showed as commulative of even the cancelled cards. App keep on prompting message to activate samsung pay and takes me to samsung pay app. My direct remit beneficiaries are all gone from record. No option shown for direct remit to India and Pakistan. This all is observed with just 1 usage. Shame that i can't go back to previous version.", 'Previous app was better. Kindly get us back there. Loan amount shows same even after payments, shows deferment applied even when it was not applied. Cant always make a call to call center to validate the data as the data is misguiding. If fixing any bugs can do, then please we request. The issue is seen in both android and IOS versions', 'Worst upgrade. Previous one was better. Many features are missing. There is no option to redeem the credit card points. Kindly allow to use the previous one.', "Unable to create future dated transactions in this application. Even the calendar is also missing. While both the options of creating new future dated transactions and viewing those transactions were/are available in the old application. A lot of other features are also missing in EI 2.0. I migrated to this app on bank's request but never thought that I will be facing so many issues. Now I can't go back to the old application.", 'Genuinely the worst banking app I have come across! I have accounts with various local and intl banks; no one has ever done an app upgrade as miserably and horribly as EI. The new upgrade is not allowing me to even login. The app as well as the new online banking version keeps saying invalid credentials whereas the old app is accepting the same credentials! This makes no sense. The customer service is useless! And I have sent an email and still no contact from app team!', 'The previous version was much better. While enabling login using biometrics, the app freezes and then it closes automatically. There are lots of bugs...please fix immediately or let us have option to revert to old version again', "There is a bug where total cash in home screen should include total cash in all kind of accounts. Then the breakdowns of each type account. The bug is only showing total cash in the current account and not all accounts. Its intermittent. Sometimes shows and sometimes doesn't. Even cannot see the option to transfer within your accounts like from Debit card to Prepaid Card. I am thinking of changing the bank, as the app is now hindering in my day to day transaction. Cant do anything on the app.", 'This new app is just beautiful, but many primary features are missing like the old App. Mainly Quick Remit & its unclear how to use it exactly, Summary of Expenses month-wise & many more.. So I would suggest retaining all the features of the Old App. This is actually downgrade with some beautification with no use!! Pls fix all the issues URGENTLY!!!', 'Lot of features are missing. It was very easy to use before. For international transfer it is very difficult to calculate the amount in other currencies. Previously there was an option that i can type whatever dirham, so that can send easly whatever dirham i want to send. Pls include old app features in this new app', "The worst upgrade! I can't transfer between accounts and the option to see currency rates on the app is gone! And when you login it sometimes does not show you all your accounts. This is an absolute disappointment", "I appreciate the new look, but from a designer's perspective, I think it needs more contrast, especially since not all users have good eyesight, and those extra sliders may confuse users too.", "Such a mess and so regret upgrading. cant access smartpass, no help on this from customer service and their useless information after long waits, can't reset and access on my PC or tablet. Such a mess and not one FAQ Tto solve this! So frustrated with the inability to access information on my own account!!!", 'The digital transformation leader of Emirates Islamic should get fired for such IT deliveries. The old app was incomplete, I admit, but it was way more user-friendly than this "new" app. In 2023 there are so many user-friendly banking applications, you could have copied. Customers want overview, convenience & ease of use. This new EI app is so bad that my son of 6years old could have made a better version. Shame on you Emirates Islamic!!', 'The new application is not working and giving me the same message since 27-Mar (session expired) and i cannot use the old one at all. I spoke to the call center on 28-Mar and was promised the digital team will call me in 4 hours and still waiting.

It has been over a week now, i'm waiting for this thing to let me in. Total desaster! And the worst part is that they have disabled the previous version. Which means, i am totally stuck.", "Most Pathetic App that EIB can come up with the design layout and user friendliness sucks. Most of the features from previous app are missing like opening a new wakala booster account. This app is not a. Upgrade it's clearly a downgrade. After opting for this disgusting app I am not even able to use the normal Online banking from my laptop.", "I was asked to proceed with updated version of app after I have downloaded can't use this app just show's a white screen. When I called customer service they have no clue.Such a pathetic customer service the person answering the call can't fix it. The person in charge don't have an answer. Not sure why such bank even exist when they are not even able to find a solution for such a simple thing. I should not be giving them even 1 star since I don't have an option I have chosen 1 star.", 'Pthatic, useless and baseless update, This App is making me to leave emirates islamic bank. Difficult to understand, Emirates islamic cleverly took the option option of secure mail so that customer cant contact with ease. I am just waiting for the day i can pay back my outstanding and asap and leave Emirates Islamic forever', "Horrible Horrible Horrible... don't download this app, it doesn't work... if you will download it you will not be able to use the older fully functional app. This app is just a gimic. Introduced by incompetent IT team", 'Difficult to use than before the navigation is not straight forward than before.

Poor app previous version is awesome And some of beneficiary details has been deleted by its own', 'Complicated and difficult. Quick remit option is not accessible as before. Charging for all international transfers? What kind of an updatation where it was zero charges for quick remit', "An upgraded version is to provide few more functions and convenience to the customer. In this upgrade most of existing functionalities are removed. We should call it as *DOWNGRADED* version of existing App. Any possibilities to enable previous version?. Once its ready with all the existing features, Release it for customers🙏🏻. I was regularly using prepaid features in EIB, now i can't transfer the money to prepaid account, and i don't have any way to use this feature now🧐.", "Not all the features are there, and the ones that are available don't work.

Its annoying, the old app was perfect I dnt know why did EI change it?', "Bring fingerprint authentication please.. Have to Login first EI bank app then EI 2.0 Why make things complicated??? Most of the basic features are not available. The software company who developed this app Don't have a testing team? Because they are testing the app with customers directly.
